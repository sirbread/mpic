# mpic

## What's mpic?
mpic is a image and audio tool which encodes audio into colorful images and decodes them back to audio. There are two main versions that were developed separately - Max's version and bread's version. We're demoing bread's version.

## Installation
_Only tested on Windows 11, Python 3.11+_

head over to the [releases](https://github.com/sirbread/mpic/releases/tag/mpic-v0.1), and download the main-other-version.exe file (this is bread's version, just named different). This should open up a PyQT6 window with controls for encoding and decoding.

## Development
```python -m venv venv```

```./venv/Scripts/Activate.ps1```

```pip install -r requirements.txt```

```python main.py```
